This is a placeholder file to remind you to add your actual image file here.

To add your profile image:
1. Save your profile photo as "peter-profile.jpeg" or "peter-profile.jpg"
2. Place it in this folder (public/images)
3. Restart the server or refresh the browser

The image should then appear on your website.

Note: If you're having trouble with the image not displaying, check:
- The file name (case-sensitive)
- The file extension (.jpg, .jpeg, .png)
- The file path in the HTML code
